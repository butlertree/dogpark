## 📚 Learning Goals
- Gain competency utalizing public api
- Use React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS with cypress
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

## 🥇 Wins
⭐ Successfully use React and React Router
⭐ Successfully implement cypress testing
⭐ Successfully navigating a public api and accessing its data for the application.  

## 🚧 Challenges
❗ When we were working on sample data with knex.js, the functions were all working but when we implemented a larger data set, we had to completely refactor because a simple dataset with hard coded foreign keys won't run into batching restraints. The larger dataset was loading into multiple terminals and we ended up getting over 630,000 objects. Refactoring and understanding how to rewrite it was a major hurdle.
